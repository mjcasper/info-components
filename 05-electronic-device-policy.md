While electronic devices can be a very helpful tool, they can also be an incredible distraction, significantly slowing the learning process. To this end, all electronic devices should be silenced and physically put away during every lecture and recitation. This means all phones, computers, and tablets* should not be brought out during class unless directed by the instructor to do so.


**Every violation of this policy will result in a grade of 0 for that day's participation assessment(s).**

- You may use a tablet during class, if you are using it to take handwritten notes.
