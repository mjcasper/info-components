> Please take some time at the beginning of the semester to make sure that you do not have any conflicts with our class schedule. All non-emergency requests for a make-up exam must be submitted by the Add/Drop deadline.


Make-up exams will only be given in the event of an emergency situation (severe illness), religious holiday, or conflict with a university sport.

In addition to a compelling and serious reason, all make-up exam requests must meet the following requirements:

**Supporting Documentation:** All requests for a make-up exam must provide supporting documentation of the situation at the time of the request. If you do not provide such documentation, your make-up exam request will be denied.

**Timeliness** 
- **For non-emergency reasons**, all make-up exam requests must be submitted to the Instructor at the beginning of the semester before the end of the Add/Drop period. All requests submitted after this deadline will be denied.
- **For emergency reasons**, all make-up exam requests must be submitted to the Instructor no later than 24 hours after the exam. All requests submitted after this deadline will be denied.
- If a make-up exam request is approved, the student is expected to complete the make-up exam at the time scheduled by the instructor. This will usually be at the end of the semester after Final Exams. 


<!--
Additionally, since Midterm Exams 1 and 2 are being conducted outside of our regular class time, you should double check these times for any work conflicts.

**Employment:** Students who are currently employed and have a conflict between their work schedule and either Midterm Exam 1 or 2, should first make a good faith effort to rearrange their work schedule so they can attend the Midterm Exam as scheduled. If the student is unable to rearrange their schedule in order to take the Midterm Exam, the student should contact the Instructor no less than 7 calendar days before the exam date. **Note that this only applies to Midterm Exams 1 and 2, since these exams are being given outside of our scheduled class time.** A work conflict request will be denied for any exams given during our regularly scheduled class time or allocated final exam time.
