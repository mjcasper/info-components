We will also have a weekly in-class peer evaluation assignment. With the guidance of the instructor or TA, you will be grading a small selection of your classmates' checkpoint exams. Don't worry, your exams will still be graded by the course staff (instructor, TA, or graders). But these peer evaluation assignments are meant to accomplish a few things:

- Help you understand what we are looking for in a successful solution, so that you can make improvements for any future attempts of your own.
- Critically reading over someone else's work and providing helpful feedback also helps reinforce your own understanding of the material.

Each peer evaluation will be graded as either (M) Meets Expectations or (P) Progressing based on whether you accurately provide helpful (and respectful) feedback on each exam assigned to you. This feedback could be comments about something you like in their work, something they could improve for next time, or maybe an explanation for why a particular step is incorrect and needs to be improved for next time. 

- **(M) Meets Expectations** indicates that you wrote down the correct solution for the peer student and provided helpful and respectful comments.
- **(P) Progressing** means your peer evaluation is either missing the correct solution or is missing comments and feedback.
