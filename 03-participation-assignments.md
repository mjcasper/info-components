During most classes we will have in-class activities that we will work on as a class either all together, individually, or in small groups. These activities will be turned in during class time.

Each in-class activity will be graded as either (M) Meets Expectations or (P) Progressing. These in-class assignments are an early part of the learning process, so you will not necessarily be graded on full comprehension. Instead, you will usually be graded based on whether an honest attempt to answer the question(s) was made (using your notes from class and the preparation materials).

- **(M) Meets Expectations** indicates an honest attempt was made on your part to solve the problem(s) using your notes from class and preparation material.
- **(P) Progressing** means your work is insufficient based on what was presented in class and preparation material up to that point.
