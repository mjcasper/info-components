There will be one Homework Assignment assigned for each learning outcome. Each set will be due at&nbsp;11:59pm ET on the day posted on WeBWorK (usually each Monday). 

You must earn a score of 95% or better to ultimately earn credit for each Homework Set.

> You are allowed **2 Homework Passes.** Each individual Homework Pass grants you a score of 100% on 1 Homework Set. These will automatically be applied at the end of the semester, in whichever configuration gives you the highest final average.
