You will submit a paper copy of your Homework Notebook containing your written solutions to the HW problems from WeBWorK.


Your notebook for each learning outcome will be graded as either: (M) Meets Expectations or (P) Progressing. The criteria we will be looking for are: number of solutions, neatness, and level of detail.

- **(M) Meets Expectations** means the notebook contains a sufficient number of solutions, is neatly written and presented, and matches the level of detail as described in the lecture examples.
- **(P) Progressing** means your notebook contains either an insufficient number of solutions, is not neatly written, or the solutions do not meet the level of detail given in the lecture examples. 



> You are allowed **2 Notebook Check Passes.** Each individual Notebook Check Pass grants you a score of (M) Meets Expectations on 1 Notebook Check. These will automatically be applied at the end of the semester, in whichever configuration gives you the highest final average.


**What to Include?**

Your written solutions for each problem, should be modeled after the solutions we do during class or in the lesson videos. Essentially, the work from class is what we want to see from you on both the homework and the exams. Additionally, to help make these notebooks a good study resource for you later on in the course, we also want to see that you:

1. Leave enough space in between problems. (Having your work crammed together makes it very difficult for you to read.) 
2. Write as neat as possible. (You will want to be able to read this again later in the semester.)
3. Use two columns for your notebook; questions in the first column, your solutions in the second column.
4. Use loose-leaf paper (do not tear the pages out of a spiral notebook).
