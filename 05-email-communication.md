It is required that your university (buffalo.edu) email address be used for all official course email correspondence.


> Any questions related to the course that are not of a personal nature should be asked <!--on the [Help Forum](https://forum.bluetangent.org) or--> during Class Time, Recitation, or Office Hours. <!--Response times are significantly faster on these platforms.-->


While we encourage everyone to ask questions about the course, email will have the slowest response time and should only be used for personal matters.  Please allow 72 hours during the work week for a response from the instructor. Email responses will only be sent out M-F during normal business hours 9am-5pm ET.  Do  not expect a response outside of these times.

- Consult the syllabus before sending an email about course policy or grading, usually the answer is already in the syllabus. 
- Emails requesting a make-up exam should clearly explain the reason for the request and provide proper documentation.
- Emails requesting an individual homework extension will not be responded to. See the course Late Policy for more details.
