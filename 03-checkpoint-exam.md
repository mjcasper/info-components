Each week, a Checkpoint Exam will be given during our scheduled lecture time. These Checkpoint Exams will test, on average, 2-4 of the learning outcomes. 

The questions asked on these exams will be very similar in format to the in-class examples as well as the WeBWorK Homework Sets. Each question is designed to assess your understanding of one particular course learning outcome. Your response for each question will be graded as one of three possibilities: (M) Meets Expectations, (P) Progressing, or (U) Unsatisfactory. 

The Checkpoint Exam grading is described in more detail in the Grading section, but in general you will have multiple opportunities (attempts) to earn full credit on these questions.
