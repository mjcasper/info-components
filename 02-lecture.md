We will be using a "semi-flipped" classroom model. This essentially means that you will be responsible for completing a preparation lesson video and reading before each scheduled lecture time, and then we will be using class to complete various graded assessments (in-class assignments, peer evaluations, checkpoint exams, etc) as well as some traditional direct instruction.

The motivation for using this approach is that you will be engaged in active learning activities while the professor or TA is present. This way you can ask questions!
