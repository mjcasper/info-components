**Midterm Exam** questions will be graded using a traditional partial credit grading scheme. 

**Checkpoint Exam** questions will **not** be graded using a traditional partial credit grading scheme.  Instead, each question will be graded as one of three possibilities:


|Grade  | Name | Description | Additional Attempt? |
|:------------:|------|------|---------------------|
| M     | Meets Expectations    | Congratulations! You've successfully demonstrated your understanding of this learning outcome. This means you have shown sufficient work, used correct notation, and ultimately arrived at the correct answer. There may be a few minor errors in your work as long as they do not detract from your overall response. | No need. You do not need to try this learning outcome on any of the remaining checkpoint exams. |
| P     | Progressing    | Keep going! You are making progress on this learning outcome, but still need a little more work to show your understanding. | Yes. You will be able to attempt this learning outcome again for full credit. |
| U     | Unsatisfactory    | You have made only minimal progress on mastering this learning outcome, or had an unexcused absence from this exam. | No. You will not be able to attempt this learning outcome again for full credit. |

**Additional Attempts**: Each Checkpoint Exam question can be attempted at least twice for full credit as long as you keep scoring (P) Progressing each time.
- The first attempt is during the lecture Checkpoint Exam.
- The second attempt is during the next Checkpoint Exam.
- Additionally, any Midterm Exam question that tests the same learning outcome may also be used as an additional attempt (at the discretion of the instructor). 

All together this means that you potentially have 3 opportunities to earn full credit on a majority of the Checkpoint Exam questions.


> **Frequently Asked Questions**
> 
> _Will my final average be affected if I achieve (P) Progressing on the first attempt, but do achieve (M) on a later attempt?_ 
> - No, there is no reduction in your final average in this case.
> 
> _Do I need to complete all questions on a Checkpoint Exam?_
> - Not necessarily. You only need to complete those questions on which you originally earned a score of P (Progressing). If you originally scored M (Meets Expectations), you do not need to complete that problem again.
